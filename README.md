# Projector

A Bootstrap styled, Markdown powered, Server-side language agnostic, database-less project / mockup presentation engine.

Ever needed a quick & easy way to share your projects / mockups and progress with your clients? Tired of using heavy and overblown PM tools or even generic directory listing for just that? Search no more. Thanks to Projector now you can simply upload your mockups, set priority for each page and you're done. It also doesn't discriminate whether you're using PHP, ROR or anything else server-side, it just works. It's *that* easy.

1. Unpack it somewhere.
2. Edit /project.md to change the project title, compatibility notice, and add pages to your project.
3. Create appropriate directories in the /project directory (same names as the pages). Case insensitive, underscores will be converted to spaces.


## Tips & Tricks
